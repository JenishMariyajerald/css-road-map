                looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
                a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>
